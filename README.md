# From Homeland to Homeland

**About**

This is my third web project created within [Practicum100](https://practicum.yandex.com) program by [Yandex](https://www.yandex.com) This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees, presenting their stories and pictures. It was supposed that I should have added a picture by my own, but as I'm no goood in photography, I used a picture of my hometown shot by someone else and added a link to the source. But the story I wrote by myself.

**Technical Details**

The projecct is created by using __HTML__ and __CSS__, and its structure is based on __BEM__ methodology. A combination of responsive and adaptive layouts is applied in order to make it look nice and correctly on various screen sizes. I did my best to make it fit the design provided by [Practicum100](https://practicum.yandex.com) in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
